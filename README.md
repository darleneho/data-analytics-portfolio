# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio
This repository contains projects and visualizations from the Data Science & Analytics program with UNLV. 


## Project_1: Can life be supported by the yellow-dwarf stars? 
This project was completed on Excel and using the Excel to create a report. The storytelling part was created my Miro. 
The goal was to determinding which stars are most likely to have nearby planets that could possibly support life and looks for planets around these stars in the search for alien lifeforms. Yellow-dwarf stars are important because that is the type of star our sun is. 

## Project_2: Which type of birdwatcher are you?
For this project, I created a dashboard that displays information about the bird migration routes for the three types of bird
watcher. The project consist of three parts: SQL and Databases, Data Wrangling and Data Visualizations. Tools I used: JupyterLab,
MySQL Workbench, Tableau, Excel
